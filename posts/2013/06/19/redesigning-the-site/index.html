    <h1>Redesigning the Site</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      <time>Jun 19, 2013</time>
      <!--<span class="tags">Tags: middleman, ruby, markdown</span>-->
    </div>

    <p>Well, I did it. I finally decided to redo my site. Not only did I move to a new design, I went a few steps further.</p>

<h2>Going Static</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve fully moved off of <a href="http://modx.com/">MODX</a>, as it was a bit too much for the tiny site that this was. I love MODX,
and would still highly recommend it to people building larger or mid-grade sites; however for my small little blog, I
wanted something I could quickly deploy up and get adding content to fast.</p>

<h2>Enter MiddleMan</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of Ruby coding recently, and decided, why not make my blog out of it? After toying around with
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for a while, I eventually settled on <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">MiddleMan</a>, an easy build
and deploy tool that I could throw a site up quickly via a Git repository. Plus, MM automatically compresses my CSS/JS,
handles post meta and dates, and does tagging for me.</p>

<p>I redesigned the site with a very, very simple and minimalistic design (still a WIP, of course). I wanted content to be
king on the site, and didn&rsquo;t want to have to think about design trends over the next few years. Choosing the plain
design enabled me to concentrate more on <em>what</em> I want to write, rather than how it is going to look.</p>

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<p>I also wanted to be able to type posts fast, without having to worry about markup. Enter <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
which I&rsquo;ve been using for years in wikis and readmes, but haven&rsquo;t full-out blogged with it yet. MiddleMan has a nice
integration with Markdown, and all my blog posts are now just simple Markdown syntax.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also using middleman-syntax for code highlighting, which was as simple as throwing in this to my MiddleMan config:</p>
<pre class="highlight text">activate :syntax
</pre>
<h2>Deploying</h2>

<p>Deploying in MiddleMan is absurdly simple. Once I&rsquo;ve got my post the way I want it, previewable via MiddleMan&rsquo;s dev
server, I just load up terminal and type:</p>
<pre class="highlight text">middleman build
</pre>
<p>It then automatically builds the site down to a static page, and then throws it up into my
<a href="https://github.com/splittingred/splittingred.github.com">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m still hosting on my server, but I may move to take advantage of GitHub&rsquo;s Pages for hosting. Currently
on my server I have a simple cronjob that updates the local git repo every minute, keeping my site running with some
nice continuous integration steps. One-step push to deploy. Gotta love it.</p>
